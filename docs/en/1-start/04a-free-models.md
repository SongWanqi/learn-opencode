# Free Models

> Best for: You want to complete your **first OpenCode conversation with 0 cost and 0 configuration**.

OpenCode includes a set of **completely free** models that require **no registration or API Key** - they work immediately after installation.

---

## Current Free Models

| Model ID | Name | Features |
|----------|------|----------|
| `glm-5-free` | GLM-5 | By Zhipu, supports reasoning, excellent Chinese performance |
| `minimax-m2.7-free` | MiniMax M2.7 | By MiniMax, supports reasoning, 200K context |
| `gpt-5-nano` | GPT-5 Nano | By OpenAI, lightweight and fast |
| `kimi-k2.5-free` | Kimi K2.5 | By Moonshot, supports reasoning, 256K context |
| `big-pickle` | Big Pickle | Hidden model, limited-time free trial |

::: tip Note
The free model list may change over time. The list shown in `/models` command is always accurate.

Free models have IP-level usage limits, suitable for trial and light use. For higher quotas, you can log in to OpenCode Zen to get an API Key.
